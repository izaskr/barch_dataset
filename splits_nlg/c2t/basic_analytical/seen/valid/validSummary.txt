The majority of YLABEL in Zarqa spend their evenings XHIGHEST , at YHIGHEST YUNIT . The least popular XLABEL to spend the evening is by XLEAST , at YLEAST YUNIT .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . We can see that those who have XLEAST have a lower YLABEL than those who have a XTHIRD XLABEL . Those with a XSECOND or a XHIGHEST on average earn much more .
The chart shows that with a XHIGHEST XLABEL Software engineers earn the highest with over ADDHIGHESTTHIRD YMAG more than XLEAST and XTHIRD . XSECOND is only ADDSECONDHIGHEST YMAG behind XHIGHEST but shows more XLABEL are needed for higher YLABEL .
Those who have a XHIGHEST do better in terms of YLABEL than BARSREST
There is an equal increase between YLABEL from XTHIRD through XSECOND to XLEAST . Engineers with XLEAST were worse off than XTHIRD ' s YLABEL by approximately ADDLEASTTHIRD YMAG .
The PLOTTITLE is shown as follows . Those with XLEAST are the lowest at YLEAST YMAG , those with a XTHIRD XLABEL come in at YTHIRD YMAG . With a XSECOND XLABEL , the engineers median YLABEL is at YSECOND YMAG and finally , those with a XHIGHEST are at the highest level of YHIGHEST YMAG .
This shows that Software Engineers with XHIGHEST earn more than their BARSREST . The lowest YLABEL are to those who have XLEAST , followed by a XTHIRD XLABEL then a XSECOND XLABEL - therefore we can take from this graph that the higher the level of education , the higher the YLABEL Software Engineers earn per year
The table shows that Software engineers with XHIGHEST earn the most , earning a median YLABEL of over YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG . XSECOND XLABEL graduates come 2nd earning on average YUNIT YSECOND YMAG . Then comes XTHIRD XLABEL graduates , earning YUNIT YTHIRD YMAG on average . Finally those with XLEAST earn the least , earning just over YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX YMAG on average .
This charts shows the PLOTTITLE . Not surprisingly , those with XLEAST earn the least ; and those with a XHIGHEST earn the most . There is a difference of about YUNIT ADDHIGHESTLEAST YMAG between these average earnings .
This graph shows a trend that the higher the qualifications held by software engineer , the greater the YLABEL they receive . Those with XLEAST receive almost MULLEASTHIGHEST of the YLABEL received by those with a XHIGHEST . Education increases earning potential .
The graphs shows the PLOTTITLE . We can see that there is an approximately YUNIT ADDHIGHESTTHIRD YMAG YLABEL difference between those with a XTHIRD XLABEL and those with a XHIGHEST but only an approximate YUNIT ADDTHIRDLEAST YMAG difference between those with a XTHIRD and those XLEAST .
This chart shows that software engineers who have a XHIGHEST XLABEL earn more YLABEL than software engineers with BARSREST . The chart demonstrates that the higher the degree , the more YLABEL earned on average .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . The largest YLABEL of YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG are those with a XHIGHEST , followed by YSECONDAPPROX YMAG for those with a XSECOND , YTHIRDAPPROX YMAG for those with a XTHIRD XLABEL and the smallest YLEASTAPPROX YMAG for those with XLEAST .
Students who have completed XTHIRD , XSECOND and XHIGHEST XLABEL earn significantly more than those with XLEAST .
This graph shows the PLOTTITLE . Those with a XHIGHEST earn the most at YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG . A XSECOND XLABEL gets average YLABEL of YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX YMAG , whilst a XTHIRD gets YUNIT YTHIRDAPPROX YMAG on average . Those with XLEAST average a YLABEL of YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX YMAG .
This graph shows that the median YLABEL a software engineer increases as the level of their XLABEL rises . Those with a XHIGHEST earn over YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG , about YUNIT ADDHIGHESTSECOND YMAG per year more than those with a XSECOND XLABEL , who in turn earn about YUNIT ADDSECONDTHIRD YMAG per year more than those with a XTHIRD XLABEL . Those with XLEAST earn the least at about YUNIT YLEAST YMAG per year .
This graph shows the PLOTTITLE . Persons holding XHIGHEST XLABEL earn the highest , followed by XSECOND , then XTHIRD and finally XLEAST .
this chart shows PLOTTITLE , those with a XHIGHEST look to earn over YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG , followed by XSECOND with YSECONDAPPROX YMAG  XTHIRD with over YTHIRDAPPROX YMAG and XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YMAG . showing that evidence indicates that the higher education you have completed the higher your YLABEL will be
The higher level of XLABEL the higher the YLABEL
This chart displays the PLOTTITLE . Those with a XHIGHEST earn the most with YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG , then XSECOND at YSECONDAPPROX YMAG , then XTHIRD at YTHIRDAPPROX YMAG and those in the field with XLEAST earn YLEASTAPPROX YMAG . This corresponds with what you would expect that those with a better education and more knowledge earn more
