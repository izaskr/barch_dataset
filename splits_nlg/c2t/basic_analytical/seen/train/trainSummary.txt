The XTHIRD XLABEL has only MULTHIRDSECOND the YLABEL that the XSECOND XLABEL has with YTHIRD YUNIT YLABEL . The XFOURTH XLABEL has a lesser YLABEL with YFOURTH YUNIT and XLEAST is MULLEASTFOURTH as much again with YLEAST YUNIT .
The title indicates the PLOTTITLE . A confusing title that does not align with the way the data is presented .  XLEAST has the lowest female YLABEL ( YLEAST YUNIT ) .
The graphs shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST was the least inclusive at YHIGHEST YUNIT , followed by XSECOND at YSECOND YUNIT , XTHIRD at YTHIRD YUNIT . The most inclusive was XLEAST at YLEAST YUNIT and XFOURTH at YFOURTH YUNIT
This graph shows the YLABEL in various XLABEL based on XLABEL . The graph displays a large difference in YLABEL with XHIGHEST having YHIGHEST YUNIT women and XLEAST only YLEAST YUNIT .
This chart shows the YLABEL in particular XLABEL to show how inclusive those XLABEL are . XHIGHEST and XSECOND have YSECOND and YHIGHEST YUNIT respectively , which is to be expected . The three XLABEL relating to GRTHIRDFOURTHLEAST XLABEL have significantly lower YLABEL . XLEAST has the lowest with YLEAST YUNIT , XFOURTH is next with YFOURTH YUNIT , and XTHIRD has YTHIRD YUNIT .

The XLABEL with the second highest is XSECOND with around YSECOND YUNIT , followed by XTHIRD with only around YTHIRD YUNIT . The XLABEL XFOURTH and XLEAST only have YFOURTH YUNIT and YLEAST YUNIT , respectively .
This table relates to YLABEL as measured by the YLABEL in XLABEL . It does not look at other measures of inclusivity such as race , culture or disability . It shows that XLEAST XLABEL are the least inclusive , with only YLEAST YUNIT women ; at the other end of the scale , XHIGHEST XLABEL have YHIGHEST YUNIT YLABEL . The nearest to YMEAN YLABEL is XSECOND XLABEL , which have YSECOND YUNIT female YLABEL .

Here is a chart about PLOTTITLE . The highest with YLABEL is XHIGHEST , followed by XSECOND . XTHIRD is the third highest and XLEAST at the lowest .
This chart represents the PLOTTITLE .   There is YTHIRD in XTHIRD , with a higher YLABEL in XSECOND and XHIGHEST .   Women appear to be under represented in the XLEAST .
This chart shows a PLOTTITLE .  From the chart we see that the highest YLABEL is in XHIGHEST at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT . We can see that the lowest YLABEL is in XLEAST at YLEAST YUNIT
this chart demonstrates that YLABEL is largest in the XHIGHEST , at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT . in comparison YTHIRD YUNIT and below of YLABEL in XTHIRD , even less is XLEAST , at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
PLOTTITLE shows what the women really want to do with their lives . The XLABEL with the highest YLABEL is XHIGHEST with around YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT of YLABEL . BARSREST like XSECOND and XTHIRD also doing good with YLABEL over YTHIRD but not more than YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT with the lowest YLABEL in XLEAST with only YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT
The bar chart shows PLOTTITLE . It shows that there are YTHIRD YUNIT women in XTHIRD , roughly YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT represented in the XSECOND and roughly YLEAST YUNIT in XLEAST . There is the greatest YLABEL in the XHIGHEST at roughly YHIGHEST YUNIT .
This chart shows the YLABEL of female staff represented in difference XLABEL . In XLEAST , just YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT are women , compared to YTHIRD YUNIT in XTHIRD , YSECOND YUNIT in XSECOND and YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT in XHIGHEST .
This chart shows the YLABEL who are employed by companies across different XLABEL . The XHIGHEST XLABEL is the highest employers of women with approximately YHIGHEST YUNIT of staff being female . This is followed closely by the XSECOND XLABEL with just over YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT female YLABEL . In XTHIRD the split between men and women is YTHIRD - YTHIRD . XLEAST have the worst YLABEL across the XLABEL studied , with just YLEAST YUNIT of staff being female .
The title tells us this chart shows PLOTTITLE . The graph actually shows female YLABEL in a variety of XLABEL .  The intention appears to be to show that there is lower YLABEL in XLEAST , at YLEAST YUNIT , compared to YMEAN YUNIT + in other XLABEL . However I would say this chart is incorrectly titled .
This chart is titled PLOTTITLE and shows that XLEAST had a YLABEL of around YLEAST YUNIT . The chart also shows other XLABEL of industy for a comparison with XTHIRD having a YTHIRD YUNIT , XSECOND with YSECOND YUNIT and XHIGHEST YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT .
The chart claims to show PLOTTITLE ( though again , the chart looks at several XLABEL not just XLEAST ) . XHIGHEST has the highest YLABEL at YHIGHEST YUNIT whilst XLEAST have the lowers ( at YLEAST YUNIT ) .
The graph shows PLOTTITLE . The graph is titled as being in XLEAST but also includes data for three other types of XLABEL ( XTHIRD , XSECOND and XHIGHEST ) for comparison .   The graph shows that XLEAST have the lowest female YLABEL at YLEAST YUNIT , behind XHIGHEST ( YHIGHEST YUNIT ) , XSECOND ( YSECOND YUNIT ) and XTHIRD ( YTHIRD YUNIT ) in that order .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE .  From the chart we see that the the majority of XLEAST provide at least YTHIRD YUNIT YLABEL ( with XTHIRD exactly at parity with YTHIRD YUNIT , and both XSECOND and XHIGHEST exceeding this , at YSECOND and YHIGHEST YUNIT respectively . XLEAST have some catching up to do , with a figure of only YLEAST YUNIT .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE and in a variety of XLABEL .  From the chart we see that the XHIGHEST XLABEL has the highest YLABEL with YHIGHEST YUNIT closely followed by the XSECOND XLABEL with YSECOND YUNIT . The XTHIRD XLABEL then follows with YTHIRD YUNIT of women represented and the XLEAST XLABEL had the lowest YLABEL with just YLEAST YUNIT .
The title indicates PLOTTITLE . However , dataset indicates YLABEL across XTHIRD , XSECOND , XHIGHEST , and XLEAST .   XHIGHEST has the highest YLABEL ( YHIGHEST YUNIT ) , closely followed by XSECOND ( YSECOND YUNIT ) . XLEAST have the lowest female YLABEL ( YLEAST YUNIT ) .
The graph shows the PLOTTITLE XLABEL . XHIGHEST sees the highest YLABEL , followed by XSECOND . XTHIRD then reported YTHIRD YUNIT . XLEAST was the lowest YLABEL representage at YLEAST YUNIT .
This graph shows the YLABEL in the XLABEL of various XLEAST . The graph shows a similar YLABEL in all areas with only XLEAST falling lower at YLEAST YUNIT , the other 3 XLABEL range between YTHIRD and YHIGHEST YUNIT .
This chart shows PLOTTITLE as a YUNIT compared with the other industries , XHIGHEST , XSECOND and XTHIRD .   The chart shows that while the other 3 had over YTHIRD YUNIT YLABEL in their XLABEL , XLEAST had around YLEAST YUNIT . .
The graph shows PLOTTITLE compared to other XLABEL .  The YLABEL in XLEAST is YLEAST YUNIT compared to YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST , YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT in XSECOND and YTHIRD YUNIT in XTHIRD .
The charts shows the PLOTTITLE by XLABEL .   The chart shows the YLABEL in XLEAST is much less than those in other XLABEL , with the XHIGHEST XLABEL leading the way but XSECOND very closely
This graph displays the PLOTTITLE . The XLABEL of XHIGHEST has the most with around YHIGHEST YUNIT , followed by XSECOND which has YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT . The XTHIRD is not far behind with around YTHIRD YUNIT , however there is a decline when it comes to XLEAST as there is only around YLEAST YUNIT .
The YLABEL working in XLEAST is significantly smaller than the YLABEL working in XTHIRD , XSECOND and XHIGHEST . At just YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT , it is ADDLEASTHIGHEST YUNIT lower than the YLABEL working in XHIGHEST ( which has the highest proportion at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT .
Chart shows the YLABEL represented by XLABEL to compare with XLEAST .  XHIGHEST has the highest YLABEL at YHIGHEST YUNIT , closely followed by XSECOND at YSECOND YUNIT , XTHIRD at YTHIRD YUNIT with XLEAST trailing at YLEAST YUNIT
This graph shows the YLABEL of the staff in different industries that are women , compared to female YLABEL in XLEAST . XLEAST are shown to have the fewest women of these XLABEL , about YLEAST YUNIT , while the XHIGHEST XLABEL employs the largest YLABEL at YHIGHEST YUNIT .
As we can see from the chart , the highest XLABEL of women is in XHIGHEST which has approximately YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT . This is then followed by XSECOND with YSECOND YUNIT , XTHIRD at YTHIRD YUNIT and the XLABEL with the least YLABEL involved appears to be XLEAST at approximately YHIGHEST YUNIT .
This graph shows the female YLABEL in COUNT different employment XLABEL . XLEAST being the lowest with only YLEAST YUNIT of employees being women .
This chart shows that women are more represented in XHIGHEST , XSECOND and XTHIRD than in XLEAST . The YLABEL in XLEAST is YLEAST YUNIT compared with YTHIRD YUNIT in XTHIRD , YSECOND YUNIT in XSECOND and YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST .  Again , the y axis is not clearly labelled - I assume it is percentage of women .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . The chart shows how the YLABEL go down each day . With a spike on XHIGHEST of YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT , XSECOND goes down to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT , XTHIRD decreases YTHIRDAPPROX YUNIT , XFOURTH decreases further to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT and then XLEAST has just YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
Bar chart PLOTTITLE .   The YLABEL decrease as the week progresses ; from YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX on XHIGHEST , to YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX on XLEAST .
The graph shows the PLOTTITLE , in YUNIT . On XHIGHEST , YLABEL were at their highest , at YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX , falling to YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX on XSECOND . There was a smaller decrease on XTHIRD to YUNIT YTHIRDAPPROX , and a marginal decrease to YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX on XFOURTH . By XLEAST , YLABEL had fallen to YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX .
The graph details the PLOTTITLE in YUNIT over the XLABEL ( XHIGHEST XEND XLEAST ) . The graph shows that overall , the YLABEL dropped as the week progressed , with significant drops from GRHIGHESTSECOND and GRFOURTHLEAST
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE , depending on the XLABEL .   The chart shows that XHIGHEST had the highest YLABEL at about YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX . This declines over the course of week with YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX on XSECOND , YUNIT YTHIRDAPPROX on XTHIRD , YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX on XFOURTH and YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX at the lowest on XLEAST .
On XHIGHEST the YLABEL for Akef Inc was YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX , on XSECOND it was YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX , on XTHIRD YUNIT YTHIRDAPPROX , XFOURTH YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX and on XLEAST it closed at YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX .
As the week has gone on the Afec Inc YLABEL has decreased . Starting at YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX on XHIGHEST and closing on YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX by XLEAST .   XFOURTH to XLEAST saw the biggest drop in YLABEL , with it being MULFOURTHLEAST from YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX on XFOURTH to YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX by XLEAST .
This chart shows the steep decline in YLABEL for Akef Inc during the course of the week . Opening on XHIGHEST , the YLABEL is at its peak of YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX , before dropping gradually over the week to an eventual low of YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX on the XLEAST .

XFOURTH , representation more than MULFOURTHFIFTH to over 7 YUNIT . The YLABEL growth slowed XTHIRD , only increasing by around 3.5 YUNIT , to YTHIRD YUNIT average growth , and again XSECOND , the YLABEL increased by less than ADDTHIRDSECOND YUNIT to just above 12 YUNIT . In recent XLABEL XHIGHEST , representation has had the lowest YLABEL growth to YHIGHEST YUNIT , with less than ADDHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT growth .
The chart shows the PLOTTITLE . The YLABEL of YLABEL has increased steadily since XLEAST until recently , XHIGHEST . From YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT of YLABEL in the XLABEL XLEAST , til YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST , there has been an overall increase of ADDHIGHESTLEAST YUNIT .
The Libyan parliament has become increasingly diverse since 1990 , when less than MULSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT of minorities were represented . This increased to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT by the XFIFTH period , more than MULFOURTHFIFTH to over YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT in XFOURTH , increased to YTHIRD YUNIT by 2005 and almost YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT by 2010 , and reached a high of YHIGHEST YUNIT in the XHIGHEST period .
This chart looks at PLOTTITLE by looking at the YLABEL of YLABEL during INTERVAL XLABEL periods . The overall trend is an increase in YLABEL from 1990 to 2019 . During the period XLEAST there was YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YLABEL . This had increased ADDFIFTHLEAST fold to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT in XFIFTH . There was a big jump in XFOURTH where representation rose to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . XTHIRD saw YTHIRD YUNIT . The YLABEL figure increased again to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT in XSECOND . The figure rises to YHIGHEST YUNIT in the period XHIGHEST .
The graph depicts the PLOTTITLE by way of detaling what YLABEL of parliamentarians were from minorities . The YLABEL has steadily grown since the time the graph began in 1990 . It has risen from YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST , to YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST . During each INTERVAL XLABEL period the minorities have increased steadily .
This chart shows the YLABEL of YLABEL within the Libyan parliament .  From the chart we see that during the XLABEL of XLEAST approximately YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT of the parliament were represented by minorities .  During the XLABEL XFIFTH this rose to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT , and continued to increase to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT during XFOURTH , increasing to YTHIRD YUNIT during XTHIRD , increasing to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT during XSECOND and increasing ti YHIGHEST YUNIT during XHIGHEST .
This chart shows how diversity in Libyan parliament has changed over the years , from 1990 , to 2019 . We can see that since 1990 , YLABEL has increased . With a YLABEL of less than YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT in the XLABEL XLEAST , this was seen to double to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT XFIFTH . At the turn of the millennium to 2004 , we see the biggest increase from YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT to just over YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . Diversity has continued to increase around SLOPEY - SLOPEY YUNIT every SLOPEX XLABEL , where we can see the most recent stats standing at YHIGHEST YUNIT YLABEL in the XLABEL XHIGHEST .
The graph illustrates the diversity in the Libyan Parliament from 1990 to 2019 . The diversity is measured by the YLABEL of minority representatives . The graph illustrates that in 1990 there was less than YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YLABEL . By 1999 this had nearly doubled to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT and by 2004 it had nearly quadrupled to just under YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . From 2005 to 2019 there was a steady increase in representation growing at SLOPEY YUNIT every SLOPEX XLABEL . Representation by minorities in the Libyan Parliament now stands at YHIGHEST YUNIT . ( XHIGHEST )
The Libyan parliament had the most YLABEL in XHIGHEST with YHIGHEST YUNIT and the least minority in XLEAST with YLEAST YUNIT . It increased in XFIFTH with just over YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT and again increased each XLABEL XFOURTH with YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT , XTHIRD with YTHIRD YUNIT and XSECOND with YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT .
As can be seen in the graph YLABEL is improves every SLOPEX XLABEL . With the highest representation in the most recent period of XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT . The lowest was the earliest period on the graph , XLEAST with YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT . From XFIFTH - XSECOND YLABEL improves from YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT . The graph clearly shows an improvement in minority representation
