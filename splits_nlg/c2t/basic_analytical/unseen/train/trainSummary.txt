The chart displays data for COUNT XLABEL in a quiz competition and details the YLABEL made by each XLABEL . The title and graphic representation are a little at odds , as the XLABEL with the tallest bars were actually the least successful . Additionally the scale for the number of mistakes is hard to read with any precision as it suggests incorrect answers could be part of a whole number . Careful reading of the data shows that XLABEL XHIGHEST made more than YHIGHESTAPPROX YLABEL but less than YHIGHESTAPPROX and were therefore the least successful XLABEL in the quiz competition . The most successful XLABEL , XLABEL XLEAST made less than YLEASTAPPROX YLABEL . XLABEL XFOURTH and XFIFTH made between YFIFTHAPPROX and YFOURTH YLABEL and XLABEL XTHIRD and XSECOND made between YTHIRDAPPROX and YSECOND YLABEL .

It had a good YLABEL in the XLABEL XHIGHEST of YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT , although this was reduced by ADDSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT in the XLABEL XSECOND , it was still a good number .  In the XLABEL XTHIRD a big jump can be seem where there YLABEL was only YTHIRDAPPROX YUNIT , YLABEL being reduced in the BARSREST years . In XFOURTH the YLABEL was YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT , going further down to YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT for XLEAST . Since then we can see a little increase for the XFIFTH XLABEL of ADDFIFTHLEAST YUNIT , which could be very slow increase in the years to come .
PLOTTITLE is seen here . The biggest XLABEL is XHIGHEST at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT . However GRSECONDLEAST are a larger XLABEL with GRSECONDLEAST combined shown to XLABEL in GRYSECONDLEAST YUNIT of cases .  This is broken down into XSECOND at YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT and XLEAST at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
