This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST has the most top 100 universities at YHIGHEST , while XSECOND is 2nd at YSECOND and XTHIRD 3rd at YTHIRD . GRLEASTLEAST have the lowest YLABEL in the top 100 at GRYLEASTLEAST each . This could be interpreted as there being better education in America , however the data could also be inaccurate , as the Top 100 Universities list is made by an American company , therefore may be bias towards American institutions .
The chart shows the YLABEL that quiz XLABEL made . The least successful XLABEL , with the most YLABEL was XHIGHEST , followed by XSECOND , then XTHIRD . Next is XFOURTH with YFOURTH , XFIFTH with YFIFTH , and the most successful XLABEL with YLEAST YLABEL was XLEAST .

This is broken down with YSECOND YUNIT of the youths who prefer to GRSECONDTHIRD like to XSECOND and the remaining YTHIRD YUNIT choosing to XTHIRD .  The youths who prefer opting for GRHIGHESTLEAST are split with YHIGHEST YUNIT preferring to XHIGHEST , while the remaining YLEAST YUNIT prefer to XLEAST .
The graph indicates the PLOTTITLE , measured by YLABEL .   XHIGHEST was the least successful XLABEL , with YHIGHEST YLABEL . XLEAST was the most successful XLABEL , with YLEAST YLABEL .   This is based on the assumption that success is measured by YLABEL .
This chart shows PLOTTITLE . YLABEL has increased XSTART XLEAST XEND XHIGHEST . XLEAST there was under YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YLABEL , but this increased to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT XFIFTH and this MULFOURTHFIFTH to nearly YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT XFOURTH . Since then there has been a SLOPEY YUNIT rise approximately every SLOPEX XLABEL . This chart shows the PLOTTITLE .  Beginning in XLEAST at less than YLEAST YUNIT , the YLABEL has grown year on year and in XHIGHEST peaked at YHIGHEST YUNIT .
This chart shows the YLABEL who are employed by companies across different XLABEL . The XHIGHEST XLABEL is the highest employers of women with approximately YHIGHEST YUNIT of staff being female .

XLEAST have the worst YLABEL across the XLABEL studied , with just YLEAST YUNIT of staff being female .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE .  From the chart we see that XSECOND and XHIGHEST are far and away the most inclusive XLABEL ( with YSECOND and YHIGHEST YUNIT YLABEL respectively ) . XTHIRD follows next some way behind ( with a YTHIRD YUNIT rate ) , whereas XFOURTH and XLEAST combined only equal the XTHIRD rate ( at YTHIRD YUNIT combined ) .
PLOTTITLE shows what the women really want to do with their lives . The XLABEL with the highest YLABEL is XHIGHEST with around YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT of YLABEL . BARSREST like XSECOND and XTHIRD also doing good with YLABEL over YTHIRD but not more than YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT with the lowest YLABEL in XLEAST with only YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT
This chart shows the money spent on higher education per XLABEL in 2010 .   XHIGHEST has the highest YLABEL at YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG , closely followed by XSECOND on YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX YMAG . XTHIRD spent YUNIT YTHIRD YMAG whilst XLEAST was the lowest XLABEL , at around YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX YMAG .
The graph details the PLOTTITLE . The graph shows that in GRHIGHESTSECONDTHIRD women make up more than GRYHIGHESTSECONDTHIRD of the XLABEL , while in the GRFOURTHLEAST XLABEL , women account for less than a GRYFOURTHLEAST of the XLABEL .
The chart shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST is the most popular XLABEL with YHIGHEST YUNIT of the cohort opting for this and XSECOND is from behind with YSECOND YUNIT . XLEAST XLABEL are MULLEASTSECOND as popular as XSECOND with YLEAST YUNIT opting for this and XTHIRD is YTHIRD YUNIT .
This chart shows the least inclusive XLABEL according to the YLABEL . IN XHIGHEST , YHIGHEST YUNIT were women , compared to YSECOND YUNIT in the XSECOND , YTHIRD YUNIT in XTHIRD , YFOURTH YUNIT in XFOURTH and YLEAST YUNIT in XLEAST .
This chart shows PLOTTITLE . Approximately YLEAST YUNIT of people XLEAST , YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND and YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT of participants XHIGHEST . About YTHIRDAPPROX YUNIT of YLABEL XTHIRD .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . We can see that XHIGHEST have the highest YLABEL out of the COUNT XLABEL and XLEAST has the lowest .
Between BARNAMES the YLABEL is biggest in XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT , a little more than in the XSECOND . XLEAST is at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
This chart shows that the YLABEL increase GRHIGHESTSECONDTHIRD ( from YUNIT YTHIRDAPPROX to YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX ) , but drop on GRFOURTHLEAST . From YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX on XHIGHEST to roughly YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX on XFOURTH , then around YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX on XLEAST .
The graph illustrates the diversity in the Libyan Parliament from 1990 to 2019 . The diversity is measured by the YLABEL of minority representatives . The graph illustrates that in 1990 there was less than YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YLABEL . By 1999 this had nearly doubled to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT and by 2004 it had nearly quadrupled to just under YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . From 2005 to 2019 there was a steady increase in representation growing at SLOPEY YUNIT every SLOPEX XLABEL . Representation by minorities in the Libyan Parliament now stands at YHIGHEST YUNIT . ( XHIGHEST )
Comparatively the YLABEL is less in XLEAST where the disparity is YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT , compared to the GRHIGHESTSECOND where the YLABEL is GRYHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT .
This chart shows PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST shows the highest level of equality at YHIGHEST YUNIT , with XSECOND showing around YSECOND YUNIT . XLEAST showed the lowest equality YLABEL at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .

This chart displays the YLABEL in COUNT XLABEL , and is titled PLOTTITLE . Again the title does not exactly describe the content of the title . It does show that the YLABEL is higher in XHIGHEST than in XLEAST and the XSECOND .  XHIGHEST has a YLABEL of YHIGHEST YUNIT , the XSECOND is 2nd with a YLABEL of YSECOND YUNIT , and XLEAST has the lowest YLABEL at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
