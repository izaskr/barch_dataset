The
chart
displays
data
for
six	<x_axis_labels_count>
teams	<x_axis>
in
a
quiz competition	<t=1_a=b>
and
details
the
number of mistakes	<y_axis>
made
by
each
team	<x_axis>
.
The
title
and
graphic
representation
are
a
little
at
odds
,
as
the
teams	<x_axis>
with
the
tallest
bars
were
actually
the
least	<y_axis_least_value>
successful	<t=1_a=b>
.
Additionally the scale for the number of mistakes is hard to read with any precision as it suggests incorrect answers could be part of a whole number	<interpretation>
.
Careful
reading
of
the
data
shows
that
team	<x_axis>
Lovely	<x_axis_label_highest_value>
made
more than	<y_axis_approx>
8	<y_axis_inferred_highest_value_approx>
mistakes	<y_axis>
but	<y_x_comparison>
less than	<y_axis_approx>
10	<y_axis_inferred_highest_value_approx>
and
were
therefore
the
least	<y_axis_least_value>
successful	<t=1_a=b>
team	<x_axis>
in
the
quiz competition	<t=1_a=b>
.
The

,
team	<x_axis>
Fearless	<x_axis_label_least_value>
made
less than	<y_axis_approx>
2	<y_axis_inferred_least_value_approx>
mistakes	<y_axis>
.
Teams	<x_axis>
DIY	<x_axis_label_4th_highest_value>
and
Cats	<x_axis_label_5th_highest_value>
made
between
2	<y_axis_inferred_5th_highest_value_approx>
